# valorant-clone-website
This project is a personal, non-commercial replica of the Valorant website's navigation UI. It was created purely for educational purposes to help me improve my front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I do not own any rights to the original Valorant brand, images, or assets. All rights belong to Riot Games. This project does not intend to infringe any copyrightsâ€”it's simply a learning exercise inspired by a design I admire.
